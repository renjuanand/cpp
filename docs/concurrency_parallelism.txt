* Concurrency

  - Concurrency means that an application is making progress on more than
    one task at the same time (concurrently). If the computer only has
    one CPU the application may not make progress on more than one task
    at exactly the same time, but more than one task is being processed
    at a time inside the application. It does not completely finish one
    task before it begins the next.

* Parallelism

  - Parallelism means that an application splits its tasks up into smaller
    subtasks which can be processed in parallel, for instance on multiple
    CPUs at the exact same time.
