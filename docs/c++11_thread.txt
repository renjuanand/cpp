* Promise and Future

- The promise is an object that can store a value of type T tobe retrieved by a future object
  (possibly in another thread) offering a synchronization point.

- The promise object is asynchronous provider and is expected to set a value for a
  shared state at some point.
- The future object is an asynchronous return object that can retrieve the value of
  the shared state, waiting for it to be ready, if necessary.
